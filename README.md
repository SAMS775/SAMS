# SAMS: Sign-Aligned Multi-Bias Vector Subtraction for Debiasing Large Language Models

This repository contains the code for our AAAI 2026 submission on structural bias mitigation in large language models using SAMS.

## ðŸ”§ Setup

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### Run Full Pipeline
```bash
python AggressiveBBQSDUTrainer.py
```
This runs the entire pipeline:
- Fine-tunes LoRA adapters on multiple BBQ bias axes
- Extracts task vectors
- Merges them via sign-consistent alignment
- Applies the final debiasing vector âˆ†â‹† to the base model
- Evaluates on BBQ (bias score + perplexity)
